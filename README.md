Hi. My name is Phil. You probably know that already if you're reading this.

If you stumbled upon this without knowing what you're getting into, well, welcome to my readme file. My goal is to help you understand what I'm doing in this GitHub repo. I have no real way of knowing if I will accomplish my aim.

At this point in time, I'm learning the beauty of JavaScript and how that beautiful language interacts with CSS and HTML. To that end, I've been engaging in a hodgepodge of online tutorials and courses. I'll be able to tell if I'm accomplishing anything if I begin creating stuff on my own and if I am able to start contributing to other developers' efforts.

If it is March 2022 when you are reading this, I am currently completing a playlist of vanilla JavaScript game tutorials published by Frank's Laboratory on YouTube. These are great. I'm learning a lot of cool things about classes and the this keyword and other things in the periphery of those fundamentals. Please try out Frank's tutorials if you have not already done so. If you perceived a grammatical error in the preceding sentence, it means that you have not learned the this keyword.

If you are reading this in the distant future and we have not colonized Mars yet, then I am probably disappointed. If you are reading this at some reasonable point past March 2022, like, say, in March 2023, I hope you are seeing some progress in my developer development. Hopefully I am creating my own stuff and helping others create theirs.

That is all for now. I hope you're having a great day and that you find some joy in life in general.

Yours truly,

Phil Hasenkamp
